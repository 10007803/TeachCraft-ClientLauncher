# TeachCraft-ClientLauncher

To execute, run the below in your terminal with Python 2.7 installed. It will then prompt you for your name:

```
python launcher.py
```

- Supports Windows, Linux, and OSX
- The first time you run it, it will take several minutes for it to download all supporting files. All subsequent loads will be nearly instant.
